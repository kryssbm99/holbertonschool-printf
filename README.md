# Custom Printf Function

## Description
This project presents a custom implementation of the `_printf` function in C, developed collaboratively by students attending Holberton coding school. The `_printf` function is used to produce formatted output to the standard output stream (`stdout`). This custom implementation aims to handle the conversion specifiers `c`, `s`, `%`, `d`, and `i`.

## Features
- Support for `%c`: Prints a single character.
- Support for `%s`: Prints a null-terminated string.
- Support for `%%`: Prints a percent character.
- Support for `%d` and `%i`: Prints signed integers.
